# Electricity Billing System - Project Summary

## Executive Summary

This is a comprehensive desktop Java application for calculating electricity bills with secure user authentication, automatic bill tracking, and comprehensive history management. The system ensures no duplicate bill calculations for the same month per user and provides a professional interface for bill management.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- **Login Frame**: Secure user login with file-based authentication
- **Signup Frame**: New user registration
- **Database Support**: Optional MySQL database integration for authentication
- **Skip Login**: Test mode for quick access

### 2. Bill Calculation Engine
- **Tiered Slab System**: 
  - Fixed Service Charge: Rs. 150.00
  - Slab 1 (0-100 units): Rs. 5.00 per unit
  - Slab 2 (101-300 units): Rs. 7.00 per unit
  - Slab 3 (301-500 units): Rs. 9.00 per unit
  - Slab 4 (Above 500 units): Rs. 11.00 per unit
- **Automatic Calculation**: Enter units consumed and get instant bill breakdown
- **Detailed Receipt**: Includes all slab costs, service charges, and total amount

### 3. Monthly Bill Locking System
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Once a month is calculated for a user, it cannot be recalculated
- **Visual Warning**: Red message displayed when attempting duplicate calculation
- **User-Specific**: Each user has their own independent monthly lock
- **Data Persistence**: Locks stored in `user_bills.dat` file

### 4. Bill History Management ("My Months" Tab)
- **Tabular Display**: Professional JTable showing:
  - Month name (January, February, etc.)
  - Year
  - Units Consumed
  - Total Bill Amount
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across all columns
- **Year Filter**: Dropdown to filter by specific year
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort, newest first by default
- **Export Feature**: Export selected bill as summary text file
- **Double-Click Export**: Quick export by double-clicking table row

### 5. File Management
- **Save Bill Receipt**: Save detailed bill to `.txt` file
- **Suggested Filenames**: Auto-generated based on meter number, month, and year
- **Export Summary**: Create compact summary files from history

### 6. Professional UI/UX
- **Clean Layout**: Well-spaced components with proper alignment
- **Consistent Colors**: Professional color scheme throughout
- **No Shadows**: Flat design for modern appearance
- **Proper Spacing**: Adequate margins and padding for readability
- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate calculator and history views
- **Contextual Actions**: Buttons change based on application state

### Data Storage

#### users.dat Format
```
username:password
ameya:1111
admin:12345
```

#### user_bills.dat Format
```
username:YYYY-MM|units|amount,YYYY-MM|units|amount
ameya:2024-01|250|1700.00,2024-02|180|1050.00
```

### Key Design Patterns Used

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between GUI, logic, and data layers
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a focused purpose
3. **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven UI with ActionListeners
4. **Factory Pattern**: Bill calculation returns structured BillDetails object
5. **Singleton Pattern**: Static storage classes for centralized data management

## User Workflow

1. **Login** → User authenticates with credentials
2. **Dashboard** → Choose to calculate new bill or view history
3. **Calculate Bill**:
   - Enter billing period (month/year)
   - Enter customer details
   - Enter units consumed
   - System checks for duplicate month
   - Calculate and display bill breakdown
   - Record to history with lock
4. **Save Receipt** → Export detailed bill to file
5. **View History** → Browse, search, filter past bills
6. **Export Selected** → Create summary file from history

## Advanced Features

### Search and Filter System
- **Real-time Search**: As you type, table filters immediately
- **Case Insensitive**: Works with any letter combination
- **Multi-Column**: Searches across all visible columns
- **Year Filter**: Dropdown selection for specific years
- **Combined Filters**: Search and year filter work together

### Data Validation
- **Input Validation**: Ensures numeric values for units and year
- **Empty Field Checks**: Prevents submission with missing data
- **Range Validation**: Validates year between 2000 and current year
- **Duplicate Detection**: Checks against user's calculated months
- **Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly error dialogs

## File Structure

### Source Files (src/)
- All Java source files with proper documentation
- Organized in logical packages
- Clean code with comments

### Data Files
- `users.dat`: User authentication data
- `user_bills.dat`: Bill history with monthly locks

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Basic Bill Calculation
1. Login with credentials
2. Click "Calculate New Bill"
3. Enter: January 2024, Customer "John Doe", Meter "M001", Address "123 Main St", Units: 250
4. Expected: Bill showing Rs. 1700 (150 + 100*5 + 150*7)
5. Check: Month should be locked for user

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Month Prevention
1. Calculate bill for February 2024
2. Try to calculate again for February 2024
3. Expected: Red error message, calculation prevented
4. Check: No duplicate entry in history

### Test Case 3: History Management
1. Calculate multiple bills for different months
2. Open "My Months" tab
3. Verify all bills displayed in reverse chronological order
4. Search for specific month or year
5. Filter by year using dropdown
6. Export selected bill
7. Expected: Summary file with correct data

### Test Case 4: Export Functionality
1. Select a bill from history
2. Click "Export Selected" or double-click row
3. Choose save location
4. Verify exported file contains correct summary
5. Expected: Text file with all bill details

## Strengths and Advantages

1. **Modularity**: Clean package structure for easy maintenance
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features (e.g., PDF export, reports)
3. **Security**: User authentication prevents unauthorized access
4. **Data Integrity**: Monthly locking prevents duplicate bills
5. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with search and filter
6. **Professional**: Clean UI suitable for production use
7. **Portable**: File-based storage, no database required
8. **Fast**: Efficient file I/O operations

## Limitations and Future Work

2. **Database Migration**: Move to MySQL for better scalability
3. **Cloud Integration**: Enable multi-device synchronization
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Charts and graphs for usage patterns
5. **Advanced Reporting**: Custom date ranges, comparisons
6. **Role-Based Access**: Admin vs regular user permissions
7. **Backup/Restore**: Data backup and recovery features
8. **Multi-Language**: Support for internationalization
9. **Themes**: Customizable color schemes
10. **Batch Operations**: Calculate bills for multiple customers
