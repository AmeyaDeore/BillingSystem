  ELECTRICITY BILLING SYSTEM - QUICK START GUIDE
=================================================================

TO LAUNCH THE APPLICATION:
--------------------------
1. Simply DOUBLE-CLICK on "START.bat"

That's it! The application will compile (if needed) and launch automatically.

FILES EXPLAINED:
----------------
START.bat  - Quick launcher (RECOMMENDED - Just double-click this!)
run.bat    - Run the application only (must be compiled first)

WHICH FILE SHOULD I USE?
-------------------------
- FOR EVERYONE: Just use START.bat (It compiles automatically if needed)
- ALREADY COMPILED: You can use run.bat for faster startup

Note: START.bat is all you need - it handles everything automatically!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If the application doesn't start:
1. Make sure Java is installed (java -version in cmd)
2. Run compile.bat first to see any compilation errors
3. Check that libs/mysql-connector-j-9.5.0.jar exists
