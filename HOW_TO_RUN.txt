    HOW TO RUN THE ELECTRICITY BILLING SYSTEM
===============================================================

QUICKEST WAY - JUST DOUBLE-CLICK:
----------------------------------
  >>  START.bat  <<
  
That's it! The application will launch automatically.


DETAILED OPTIONS:
-----------------

1. START.bat (RECOMMENDED)
   - Automatically checks if compilation is needed
   - Compiles if source files have changed
   - Launches the application immediately
   - Best for daily use
   - Just double-click and go!

2. launch.bat
   - Compiles and runs in one step
   - Useful when you've modified code
   - Always compiles before running

3. compile.bat (then run.bat)
   - Manual two-step process
   - Use compile.bat first to compile
   - Then use run.bat to launch
   - Good for advanced users

4. run.bat (standalone)
   - Only runs the application
   - Assumes already compiled
   - Fastest if no code changes


FOR FIRST TIME USERS:
---------------------
1. Make sure Java is installed (java -version in cmd)
2. Double-click START.bat
3. The application will compile automatically
4. Login with: admin / 12345


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- "Java not found" → Install Java JDK 8 or higher
- "Compilation failed" → Check src folder has all .java files
- "Class not found" → Delete bin folder and run START.bat again
- Application not starting → Delete bin folder and run START.bat again


FILES EXPLAINED:
----------------
START.bat  → Quick launcher (RECOMMENDED - Use this!)
run.bat    → Run only (must be compiled first)

Source code: src/com/billing/
Compiled files: bin/com/billing/
Data files: users.dat, user_bills.dat
